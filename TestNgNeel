Assert is a class.Helps to validate certain action.
Assert.assertEquals(ACTUAL,EXPECTED,”My message”); -> One example
Compares actual and expected value and prints error message on failure

Assert.assertTrue(true/false);
This always expects true boolean value

Hard Assert terminates entire program even if single Assert fails

Soft Assert does not terminate entire program, provides failure information at the end of execution
Soft Assert is a seperate class
Need to create SoftAssert class object
